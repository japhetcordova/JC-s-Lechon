# 🌟 Lessons Learned from JC’s Lechon Project  
*Reflections from a Junior Developer’s First Real-World Build*

As a junior developer, diving into the JC’s Lechon project was both exciting and intimidating. It was my first full build—from scratch—and it taught me way more than just how to write code. Here are ten key lessons I learned, in the order I wish I had learned and followed them.

---

## 1. Always seek inspiration before diving in  
Before opening your code editor, get inspired. Look at designs, visit competitor websites, or browse Dribbble and Behance. This fuels your imagination and helps you set a visual direction. When I skipped this step, I found myself lost, constantly unsure how I wanted the site to feel. Inspiration is fuel—it can save you hours later.

---

## 2. Know your users — always keep them in mind  
It’s easy to get caught up in fancy animations or cool layouts, but the real question is: *Will this help the user?* For JC’s Lechon, I had to ask myself: “Who will visit this site? What are they looking for?” Understanding the customer helped me simplify decisions. It’s not about what *I* like—it’s about what works for *them*.

---

## 3. Start with planning your storage and data structure  
Data comes first. Even if you’re just using plain JavaScript, think about what you're storing—products, orders, prices—and how you’ll retrieve it. I made the mistake of coding buttons before knowing how the order system would work. That forced me to redo a lot. Storage is the foundation. Lay it down properly.

---

## 4. Sketch out the frontend layout with basic boxes and wireframes  
Don’t jump straight into detailed designs. I sketched rough boxes using pen and paper and sometimes just drew `div` outlines. This helped me focus on layout and flow before worrying about colors and fonts. It’s easier to move boxes around than to redesign a polished UI.

---

## 5. Implement the core functionalities first before adding extras  
It’s tempting to add that cool animation or a toggle button for themes. But if the cart doesn’t work, none of that matters. Focus on core logic: Can users browse products? Place orders? Is the data updating? Fancy features mean nothing without working fundamentals.

---

## 6. Stick to the plan — don’t add features unless the core is fully functional  
This one was tough. I kept getting “new ideas” while coding and wanted to add more—like a testimonial slider or product filters. But each new idea distracted me from completing the essentials. Lesson: You can *always* add later. Prioritize shipping something complete.

---

## 7. Code everything initially in a single HTML, CSS, and JS file for simplicity  
As a beginner, I learned that simplicity is powerful. Putting all my code in one HTML file (at least at first) helped me debug and understand how everything connected. Once I understood the flow, I started modularizing. But early on, don’t overengineer.

---

## 8. Choose a consistent design system: 4 colors, 4 text sizes, 2 font styles, and adapt it for night mode  
Instead of picking random colors and font sizes, I decided to limit my design system. It made the UI feel more consistent and saved me time from making endless style decisions. Night mode came last—but being ready for it in the design made the transition smoother.

---

## 9. Apply the MVC pattern later — once everything is working  
Don’t start with architecture. It sounds cool to say “I’ll use MVC,” but if you haven’t even figured out your app flow, it’s premature. I learned to write the app first in a basic form. Once it worked, then I could refactor it to MVC or component-based structure. Do first, structure later.

---

## 10. Most importantly, pray before you start  
This one might be personal, but for me, it's powerful. Before coding, I always pause and pray. It gives me clarity, patience, and peace—especially when things get frustrating. Coding isn’t just about skill; it’s about mindset. And a peaceful mindset builds better projects.

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts  
JC’s Lechon wasn’t just a food ordering website—it was my training ground. These lessons came from trial, error, and a lot of late nights. And I know I still have much more to learn. But if you’re a fellow junior dev starting your own project, I hope these lessons can guide you a little along the way.
